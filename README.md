### PROG8245 Lab 2 - Data Collection and Pre-processing

This is my Lab 2 for PROG8245. Itâ€™s a Jupyter Notebook where I work with a fake e-commerce dataset. I load a CSV, clean up messy data, add some new columns, and make a data dictionary. The point is to practice data engineering tasks like cleaning and analyzing.

## Quick Start
1. Grab the repo: `git clone <https://github.com/AiswaryaSukumar/PROG8245_Data_Collection_and_Preprocessing_lab1.git>`
2. Set up a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
3. Install the needed packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook Lab_2.ipynb`

## Data Sources
- Main data: Fake CSV file (`Data/Ecommerce2025.csv`) I made using Faker.
- Extra data: Made-up coupon details from a website (https://example.com/coupon_info).
